# üîê 100 Days of Identity and Access Management (IAM)

This repository is a daily log of my learning journey in the field of **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**.

IAM plays a critical role in cybersecurity by ensuring that the right individuals have the right access to systems and data ‚Äî securely, efficiently, and in compliance with regulations.

## üìò What You'll Find Here

Through this repository, I aim to:

- Understand key IAM concepts such as **authentication**, **authorization**, **access governance**, and **user lifecycle management** and many more.
- Explore tools like **AWS IAM**, **Saviynt**, **SailPoint**, and **Azure AD** etc.
- Practice real-world use cases such as **JML (Joiner-Mover-Leaver)** flows, **policy enforcement**, **access reviews**, and **SoD (Segregation of Duties)**etc.
- Build hands-on examples and automate common IAM tasks using **scripting**, **APIs**, and **infrastructure as code**

Each entry in this repository is a self-contained topic or implementation related to IAM. It is designed to serve as both a **personal learning archive** and a **reference** for others interested in gaining practical IAM experience.
