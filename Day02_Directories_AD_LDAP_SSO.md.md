##  Where Are Identities Stored?

Identities (like users, devices, or systems) are stored in secure data sources known as **identity repositories**. Common places where identities are stored:

| Source              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Database (DB)     | Custom-built systems store user info in SQL/NoSQL databases.                |
| ‚úÖ Directory Service | Structured systems that store and manage identities (like Active Directory).|
| ‚úÖ Active Directory  | A Microsoft-based directory used by most enterprises.                       |
| ‚úÖ Cloud Directory   | e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD, Google Cloud Identity.                             |
| ‚úÖ LDAP Directory    | Lightweight directory with hierarchical structure.                          |
| ‚úÖ Servers           | Legacy systems or applications may store local user info.                   |
| ‚úÖ HR Systems        | e.g., Workday, SAP SuccessFactors ‚Äî source of truth for employee info.      |

##  What Is a Directory?

A **directory** is like a **digital telephone directory**.

- It stores structured info like names, email IDs, departments, phone numbers, etc.
- It helps **organize and manage user identities** across systems.

>  Real-life Example:  
> A **telephone directory** stores names & numbers alphabetically.  
> A **digital directory** stores usernames, roles, passwords, departments, etc.

##  What Is Active Directory (AD)?

**Active Directory (AD)** is a **directory service by Microsoft** used by organizations to **store and manage identities**, such as:

- Employees
- Computers
- Groups
- Printers
- Devices

### Why Do Companies Use AD?

- Central place to **store users and devices**
- Helps with **authentication** (login) and **authorization** (permissions)
- Easy to **add, update, delete, and search** users
- Used by tools like IAM solutions, HR systems, etc.

> **AD = Source of Truth**
> Everything in IAM depends on the data in AD ‚Äî from login to access control.

###  AD in Action

| AD Connected To       | Purpose                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| IAM Tools (e.g., SailPoint) | Sync users and roles                       |
| HR Systems             | Sync employee status (join/leave/update)      |
| Applications           | Login using AD credentials (SSO)              |

##  Components of Active Directory

| Component             | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Domain Services**    | Logical structure (e.g., `mycompany.com`) that defines network identity.     |
| **LDAP**               | A communication **protocol** to query and modify directory data.             |
| **Domain Controllers** | Servers that store AD and respond to auth requests.                         |

---

##  AD Structure: Organizational Units (OUs)

AD uses a **tree-like structure** to group and organize users.

###  Organizational Units (OUs)

- Like folders inside folders.
- Group users by departments or teams.
- Helps assign group policies or permissions.

> **Example**:
> ```
> Company
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HR
> ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Recruiters
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Development
> ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Frontend Devs
> ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Backend Devs
> ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DevOps
> ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Security
> ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Finance
> ```

##  What Is LDAP?

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** is a **protocol** (like HTTP or FTP) used to communicate with directory services like Active Directory.

###  What LDAP Does

- Acts as a **messenger between applications and directories**
- Helps **search, retrieve, add, delete, or update** directory entries

> **Analogy**:
> AD = water tank  
> App = bucket  
> LDAP = the tap used to fetch water (data)

### LDAP Port Numbers

| Port | Purpose         |
|------|-----------------|
| 389  | Standard LDAP   |
| 636  | Secure LDAP (LDAPS) |

##  What Is Desktop SSO (DSSO) ‚Äì Kerberos?

**Desktop SSO (Single Sign-On)** allows users to **log into their computer once** and automatically gain access to all apps and systems ‚Äî without re-entering credentials.

It uses **Kerberos** ‚Äî a secure authentication protocol.

###  How Kerberos Works (Simplified)

1. User logs into laptop (AD login).
2. Kerberos gives a **ticket** (like a movie ticket).
3. User uses the ticket to access apps like Outlook, HR portal, Jira, etc.

###  Real-Life Analogy

> Think of a **Kerberos ticket like an entry stamp** in a theme park.  
> You show the stamp (ticket) at each ride (app) to prove you‚Äôre authorized ‚Äî no need to show ID again and again.

### Benefits of DSSO

- Saves time for users
- Improves user experience
- Strengthens security (no password reuse)
