# Day 3: Federation, Authentication, Authorization & Compliance â€“ Foundation of IAM

---

## Federation â€“ The Backbone of Connected Identity

**Federation** allows a user to log in once and access multiple systems without re-entering credentials. It connects different identity systems using trust relationships.

### Real-life Example â€“ Multi-vendor SSO at a Product Company:
A MNC like **XYZ** uses federation to enable its employees to access third-party SaaS apps like **Salesforce**, **Workday**, **GitHub**, and **Zoom** via a single company identity. The companyâ€™s IDP (like Azure AD or ForgeRock) issues tokens (via SAML or OIDC), which those SaaS apps trust.

### What Federation Enables:
- **SSO (Single Sign-On)** across multiple systems
- Enforces **MFA** before access is handed off to external systems
- Supports **third-party identity providers** (e.g., partner orgs logging into your systems)
- Reduces need to manage separate credentials in every service

---

## Authentication â€“ Proving Identity

Authentication answers the question: **"Are you who you claim to be?"**

Itâ€™s the gate that checks user identity before any access is granted.

### Types of Authentication with Real-world Use:
- **LDAP** â€“ Still used in legacy and enterprise apps for directory-based login (e.g., internal HR portals)
- **Kerberos** â€“ Common in Microsoft enterprise environments (e.g., accessing shared drives or printers)
- **SAML / OIDC / WS-Fed / WS-Trust** â€“ Used to authenticate users from federated/cloud systems like Google Workspace, AWS Console, Salesforce

### Example:
You log into your company laptop. Your username/password is validated by Active Directory (Kerberos). Then, using SSO (via SAML), you access internal HR apps without re-entering your credentials.

---

## Pass-through Authentication â€“ Hybrid Identity Strategy

**Pass-through Authentication (PTA)** is used when organizations keep credentials on-premises but want cloud authentication. Cloud passes the credential to on-prem AD securely for validation.

### Real-life Example:
You log into **Microsoft 365** from your browser. Azure AD receives the login request and forwards it to your on-prem Active Directory via PTA. Passwords arenâ€™t stored in Azure AD. It's seamless.

> **When Used:**
> - Hybrid environments (on-prem + cloud)
> - Compliance policies prevent cloud password storage
> - Want real-time password validation without sync delays

---

## Pre-auth vs Post-auth â€“ When Access Controls Kick In

### Pre-authentication
Occurs *before* a user is fully authenticated. It blocks or filters logins based on certain policies.

#### Use Case:
An IAM policy blocks any login request from outside India unless the user is on a trusted device. This is enforced even before username/password validation begins.

### Post-authentication
Occurs *after* a successful login. The system checks what resources the user can now access.

#### Use Case:
A user logs into **AWS Console**. After authentication, IAM policies prevent them from accessing S3 but allow EC2 management.

### Benefits:
- **Pre-auth** reduces risk from untrusted devices or geolocations
- **Post-auth** supports fine-grained access decisions and session-level control

---

## Authorization â€“ What Youâ€™re Allowed to Do

After authentication, **authorization** determines *what you can do*.

### Models:
- **RBAC** â€“ HR Manager gets access to HR tools
- **ABAC** â€“ Access based on location, device, time
- **PBAC** â€“ Access rules defined by central policy engine

### Real-life Example:
An employee logs into ServiceNow. If they're from Finance, they can access invoice-related tickets. If theyâ€™re from IT, they can manage user provisioning.

---

## Authorization Use Cases in IAM

- **Federation Outcome:** Federation provides the identity. Authorization decides the access.
- **Granular Access:** You can grant access down to file, button, or field level
- **Least Privilege:** Users only get whatâ€™s needed (nothing more)
- **Segregation of Duties (SoD):** Critical in finance/IT. No user should deploy code *and* approve change requests.
- **Just-in-Time Provisioning (JIT):** Temporary access given dynamically and revoked after a task.

---

## Least Privilege â€“ Security by Limiting Access

Organizations must ensure users only get what they *absolutely need*. Not more.

### Real-world Example:
A DevOps engineer in **a fintech startup** gets access to non-prod AWS accounts for testing, not production. Access to production is given temporarily via ticket approval.

### Why It Matters:
- Reduces blast radius during compromise
- Meets audit and compliance demands
- Enables safer collaboration with contractors or vendors

> IAM platforms like **Saviynt, SailPoint, ForgeRock** enforce least privilege through dynamic access provisioning and role-based access controls.

---

## Zero Trust â€“ Security Without Borders

**Zero Trust** means never trusting any entity by default â€” even inside your network. Trust is earned dynamically, with multiple factors.

### Real-life Industry Use:
- **Google BeyondCorp**: Employees access apps based on device trust, location, role, and real-time signals
- **Okta + Zscaler**: Only devices with valid certificates and up-to-date patches can access cloud resources

### Use Case:
A remote employee must:
- Be on a corporate-managed device
- Use MFA
- Be located within approved countries
- Pass real-time checks (e.g., antivirus running)

Only then can they access internal apps.

---

## Segregation of Duties (SoD) â€“ Preventing Risky Combinations

SoD ensures users can't misuse systems by having too many powerful roles at once.

### Real-life Enterprise Use Case:
In a **banking system**, a person who creates new loan applications must not be able to approve or disburse them. IAM systems flag these violations.

> Platforms like **SAP GRC**, **Saviynt**, and **SailPoint** have SoD engines that scan for role conflicts.

---

## Compliance â€“ Why IAM Exists in Enterprises

IAM doesnâ€™t exist in a vacuum. Itâ€™s often implemented to **meet compliance needs**.

### Real-life Examples:
- **Positive:** An insurance company uses IAM for RBAC and passes its annual ISO audit.
- **Negative:** A pharma company gets fined under GDPR for not deleting a customerâ€™s identity after account closure.

### Compliance Frameworks that Drive IAM:
- **SOX** â€“ Ensure SoD in financial workflows
- **HIPAA** â€“ Restrict healthcare data access
- **GDPR** â€“ Manage consent, right-to-be-forgotten, and access controls

Without strong IAM, compliance is nearly impossible.
