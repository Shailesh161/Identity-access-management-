## ðŸ”¹ What is the JML Lifecycle?

**JML (Joiner-Mover-Leaver)** is the identity lifecycle management process followed by organizations to control user access from **onboarding** to **offboarding**.

In simple terms:

* **Joiner:** When someone joins the company.
* **Mover:** When they change roles, departments, or teams.
* **Leaver:** When they leave the company.

Each phase should automatically trigger access changes through the IAM system.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Why JML Matters in IAM

1. **Security:** Prevent unauthorized access.
2. **Compliance:** Ensure timely de-provisioning of access.
3. **Efficiency:** Speed up onboarding and internal transfers.
4. **Audit Readiness:** Clear trace of access history over time.

Without JML, accounts stay active long after employees leave or move, leading to access creep and insider risk.

## ðŸ”¹ How IAM Enables JML (Step-by-Step)

###  Step 1: Integration with Source of Truth (HRMS)

IAM connects with Workday, SAP SuccessFactors, BambooHR, etc., to detect changes.

* When HR adds/updates a user, IAM gets notified in real time.

###  Step 2: Identity Creation and Role Assignment

IAM creates a digital identity using attributes like title, department, and location.

* Roles are auto-assigned (via RBAC or ABAC logic).
* Group memberships and app access are provisioned automatically.

###  Step 3: Monitoring and Policy Enforcement

IAM continuously monitors identities for events:

* Role change triggers SoD checks.
* Long-inactive accounts flagged for review.

###  Step 4: Leaver Automation and Access Revocation

When someone exits:

* IAM disables access to all systems.
* Notifies stakeholders (manager, IT, HR).
* Ensures compliance with defined offboarding SLA.

###  Step 5: Reporting and Audit Logging

All access events are logged:

* What access was granted, changed, or revoked.
* Timestamped logs for compliance reviews.

## ðŸ”¹ Traditional vs IAM-Based JML Process

| Aspect                | Traditional Process                    | IAM-Based JML Process                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Joiner provisioning   | Manual by IT (emails/tickets)          | Automatic from HR feed                            |
| Mover role changes    | Often missed or delayed                | Triggered by role/department change in HRMS       |
| Leaver deprovisioning | Manual and error-prone                 | Automatically revokes access, alerts stakeholders |
| Audit readiness       | Incomplete logs, manual trails         | Centralized, timestamped access and change logs   |
| Risk exposure         | High (standing access, stale accounts) | Low (least privilege, time-bound access)          |

## ðŸ”¹ Real-Life Use Cases of JML in IAM

### 1. **Joiner â€“ Day One Access Provisioning**

**Scenario:** A software engineer joins the product team.
**IAM Workflow:**

* HR system updates the new hire in Workday.
* IAM detects the new entry.
* Auto-assigns `Engineer_Role`.
* Access granted to Jira, GitHub, Slack.
  **Why it matters:** Engineer is productive from Day 1.

### 2. **Mover â€“ Transfer to Security Team**

**Scenario:** QA engineer shifts to InfoSec team.
**IAM Solution:**

* Change detected in HR tool.
* IAM revokes old roles (`QA_Tester`), assigns new (`Security_Analyst`).
* SoD checks prevent role conflict.
  **Why it matters:** Prevents excessive or conflicting access.

### 3. **Leaver â€“ Clean Offboarding**

**Scenario:** Employee resigns.
**IAM Steps:**

* HR logs resignation.
* IAM revokes access to apps, disables identity.
* Notifies asset team for hardware recovery.
  **Why it matters:** Closes all access paths, avoids insider threat.

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits of Implementing JML in IAM

* **Consistency:** Fewer manual errors.
* **Scalability:** Works across thousands of users.
* **Reduced Risk:** No access creep or orphan accounts.
* **Compliance-Ready:** Easy to show access changes to auditors.
* **Speed:** Automated access improves productivity.

## ðŸ”¹ Common Pitfalls and Fixes

| Problem                            | Fix                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Manual provisioning delays         | Integrate IAM with HRMS and use automation                     |
| Orphan accounts after resignations | Trigger automated de-provisioning from HR feed                 |
| Access creep during role change    | Build movement policies with revocation logic                  |
| No audit trail                     | Ensure IAM logs all events (join/move/leave) to a central SIEM |

## ðŸ”¹ JML + IAM = Identity Lifecycle Done Right

IAM doesnâ€™t just help with access control â€” it acts as a bridge between HR, IT, and security to ensure that identity data is always in sync, access is always accurate, and risk is always managed.

If implemented properly:

* IAM automates 90% of the JML tasks.
* It enforces SoD, RBAC, and deprovisioning rules in real time.
* It ensures your org never fails an audit because of stale or excessive access.

---

## ðŸ”š Final Thoughts

The JML lifecycle is **not just about onboarding and offboarding** â€” itâ€™s about managing identities securely *throughout their journey* in the organization.
