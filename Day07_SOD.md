## What is Segregation of Duties (SoD)?

**Segregation of Duties (SoD)** is a principle in Identity and Access Management (IAM) that ensures **no single person has control over all critical steps of a business process**. This limits the risk of fraud, mistakes, or intentional misuse of privileges.

### In simple terms:
> “No one should be able to create, approve, and execute the same task.”

For example, in a finance system, one employee should **not** be able to create an invoice *and* approve payment for it. IAM systems enforce this separation through access control rules.

## Why SoD Is Necessary

- **Reduces insider fraud** by avoiding excessive access.
- **Improves internal checks** — each function is verified by someone else.
- **Mandatory for compliance** under SOX, ISO 27001, GDPR, etc.
- **Limits errors** — especially in high-risk tasks like payroll, access provisioning, or procurement.

## Real-Life Use Cases of SoD in IAM

### 1. Finance: Invoice Creation and Approval

**Scenario:**  
An employee in accounts payable can both enter and approve vendor invoices.

**Risk:**  
They could approve fake invoices to themselves or external parties.

**SoD Fix:**  
IAM platforms assign:
- Role A: Creates invoices.
- Role B: Approves them.

IAM systems ensure no user can hold both roles simultaneously.

### 2. IT: Server Provisioning and Access Assignment

**Scenario:**  
A cloud admin who creates virtual machines also assigns access to them.

**Risk:**  
They might create a server and grant unauthorized access, bypassing security.

**SoD Fix:**  
- Role A provisions infrastructure.
- Role B manages user access.

Tools like SailPoint or Saviynt detect and prevent this overlap automatically.

### 3. HR: Employee Data + Payroll Processing

**Scenario:**  
An HR staffer can edit salary details and initiate payroll payments.

**Risk:**  
They could increase their own salary and process it without oversight.

**SoD Fix:**  
- HR_Data_Manager → edits employee profiles.
- Payroll_Admin → runs payroll.

IAM tools enforce this boundary and alert on violations.

## Examples of Common SoD Conflicts

| Area         | Conflict Combination                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Finance      | Vendor Creation + Vendor Payment          |
| HR           | Salary Edit + Payroll Processing          |
| IT           | Server Provisioning + Admin Role Granting |
| Compliance   | Writing Policies + Reviewing Compliance   |

## How IAM Enforces SoD

1. **Define Toxic Combinations**  
   E.g., “Role A and Role B should not exist together on any user.”

2. **Configure SoD Rules in IAM Platforms**  
   Tools like SailPoint, Saviynt, Oracle IAM allow creating SoD policies.

3. **Detect and Prevent Violations**  
   During access request or certification, system blocks conflicting assignments.

4. **Approval for Exceptions (with Justification)**  
   In rare cases, someone may need both roles temporarily. Exceptions are routed for senior review.

5. **Regular Audits and Cleanup**  
   IAM platforms generate SoD violation reports to stay compliant.

## Regulations That Require SoD

### 1. **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)**
- A U.S. law to protect investors from financial fraud.
- Requires separation of financial duties like invoice creation, approval, and payment.

### 2. **ISO 27001**
- A global standard for information security.
- Calls for segregation of roles to reduce risks and control access.

### 3. **GDPR**
- European law for personal data protection.
- Encourages distinct duties for data processing vs data protection to avoid misuse.

SoD implementation helps meet these legal obligations and avoid penalties.

## SoD vs Least Privilege: What’s the Difference?

| Concept           | Meaning                                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Least Privilege** | Give only the minimum access required to do a job       |
| **SoD**            | Avoid combining conflicting duties in the same person    |

They complement each other. Least Privilege limits scope; SoD separates control.

## Benefits of SoD in IAM

- **Prevents Internal Fraud**  
  No one person can complete and hide a risky action.

- **Supports Audit and Compliance**  
  Regulatory checks are easier when duties are clearly separated.

- **Reduces Operational Risk**  
  Sensitive processes are monitored and split across trusted roles.

- **Boosts Organizational Trust**  
  No single person has unchecked control — everyone is accountable.

## Common Challenges with SoD

| Challenge                  | Solution                                             |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Too many role combinations | Use IAM tools with built-in SoD policy engines      |
| False positives            | Allow documented exceptions with expiration policy  |
| User resistance            | Explain real incidents of SoD failure (e.g., fraud) |
| Manual SoD review          | Automate using access reviews and certification     |

## Final Thoughts

**Segregation of Duties is a proactive control, not a reactive fix.**  
It prevents breaches before they happen and builds a layered defense strategy around people and processes.
