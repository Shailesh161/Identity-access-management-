# Just-in-Time (JIT) Access

## ðŸ”¹ What is JIT Access?

**Just-in-Time (JIT) Access** means giving access to systems *only when itâ€™s needed and only for a short time*. After that, access is automatically removed â€” no manual revocation required.

This helps organizations solve one of the most dangerous IAM issues: **standing privileges** â€” where users keep permanent access to high-risk systems even if they donâ€™t need it all the time.

**Analogy:** Like a hotel room key that expires at checkout â€” you only access the room while you're supposed to.

## ðŸ”¹ Why JIT Access is Critical

| Problem                           | What Happens Without JIT                                          |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Permanent admin access            | Admins can log in anytime, increasing risk of misuse or breach   |
| Insider threats                   | Unused access rights remain active, potentially abused later     |
| Compliance failures               | Regulators flag unused or stale permissions                      |
| Forgotten vendor access           | Contractors still have access even after the project ends        |

## ðŸ”¹ Real-Life Use Cases of JIT Access

### 1. Temporary Admin Support for Production Servers

An IT engineer needs admin rights to debug a failed service in production. They donâ€™t have default access â€” they:
- Raise a JIT access request,
- Get auto-approved via policy,
- Gain access for 30 minutes.

After that, access is revoked and fully logged.

 **Why it matters:** Reduces the risk of unnecessary long-term admin access while still resolving issues quickly.

### 2. Short-Term Database Access for a Vendor

A performance tuning vendor is hired to work on a database for 2 days.

- JIT access is approved by the project owner.
- Itâ€™s scoped to **only** the required schema.
- Logging and expiry are set automatically.

 **Why it matters:** Helps prevent unnecessary access to PII or financial data outside project scope.

### 3. Emergency Access via Break-Glass

During a system outage at midnight, a senior engineer invokes **break-glass JIT access**:

- Access is logged with justification.
- Notifications are sent to security and audit teams.
- A post-incident review ensures it was legitimate.

 **Why it matters:** Maintains accountability even during critical escalations.

## ðŸ”¹ How JIT Works (Behind the Scenes)

1. **User Request or Triggered by Workflow**
2. **Policy or Manager Approval**
3. **Access Role Temporarily Assigned**
4. **Access Auto-Revoked After Time Limit**
5. **Logging and Monitoring in SIEM or IAM Tool**

## ðŸ”¹ Tools That Support JIT Access

| Tool           | How It Enables JIT Access                                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CyberArk       | Temporarily check out privileged credentials                        |
| BeyondTrust    | Endpoint privilege elevation (for minutes or hours)                |
| SailPoint      | Time-based role provisioning via access request workflows          |
| Saviynt        | Automates JIT access based on project roles or risk score          |
| Azure AD PIM   | Grants Azure roles (e.g., Contributor, Reader) for a limited time   |

## ðŸ”¹ Benefits of JIT Access

- **Reduces Attack Surface:** Access is granted only when needed.
- **Improves Audit Readiness:** Everything is logged and monitored.
- **Eliminates Access Creep:** No leftover roles or permissions.
- **Boosts Productivity:** Users get access quickly without long approval cycles.
- **Supports Zero Trust:** No default trust â€” access is always verified and short-lived.

## ðŸ”¹ Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge                    | Fix                                                             |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Delayed approvals            | Automate with policies (e.g., no need for approval after 8 PM)  |
| Manual de-provisioning       | Use IAM platforms with auto-expiry features                     |
| Admins resisting changes     | Start with read-only JIT roles, then expand                     |
| Gaps in logging              | Integrate with centralized SIEM tools for real-time audit       |

## ðŸ”¹ When to Use JIT vs Regular Access

| Scenario                                  | Recommendation         |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Daily job duties                          | Use RBAC or ABAC       |
| Rare production access                    | Use JIT                |
| Emergency situations                      | Break-glass + JIT      |
| Short-term vendors or consultants         | Use JIT                |
| Auditors needing temporary read-only view | Use JIT                |

##  Final Thoughts

JIT is not about slowing people down. Itâ€™s about **empowering access responsibly** â€” with controls, visibility, and automatic expiry.

It fits perfectly into a modern **Zero Trust** architecture, helping organizations:
- Lower their insider risk,
- Meet audit and compliance goals,
- Keep systems resilient and trustworthy.
