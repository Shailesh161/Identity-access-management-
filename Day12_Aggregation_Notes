# 100 Days of IAM

## Day 07 – Full vs Delta Aggregation in SailPoint ISC

---

## 🔹 What is Aggregation in SailPoint ISC?

In **SailPoint Identity Security Cloud (ISC)**, aggregation is the process of **fetching identity-related data from target applications into SailPoint**.

During aggregation, SailPoint collects:

* User accounts
* Entitlements (roles, groups, permissions)
* Account–entitlement relationships

👉 In simple terms, aggregation means **synchronizing application data into SailPoint** so identities can be governed.

---

## 🔹 Full Aggregation (Unoptimized Aggregation)

### Definition

**Full Aggregation** fetches **all data from the target application**, irrespective of whether the data has changed or not.

It includes:

* All accounts
* All entitlements
* All account–entitlement mappings

---

### When is Full Aggregation Used?

* Initial onboarding of an application
* Major schema or attribute changes
* Data corruption or reconciliation scenarios
* Rare baseline refresh operations

---

### Real-Life IAM Example

**Application:** Active Directory (AD)

* AD contains 50,000 users
* SailPoint runs a Full Aggregation

**Outcome:**

* All 50,000 users are imported
* All AD groups are imported
* Complete user–group relationships are created

Even if only one user changes later, Full Aggregation still reads **all 50,000 accounts**.

---

### Key Characteristics

* Time-consuming
* High load on source application
* Provides a complete snapshot of data
* Not recommended for frequent execution

---

### Simple Analogy

Reading the **entire book again**, even if only one page was updated.

---

## 🔹 Delta Aggregation (Optimized Aggregation)

### Definition

**Delta Aggregation** fetches **only the changes** since the last successful aggregation.

It processes:

* Newly created accounts
* Updated accounts
* Deleted or disabled accounts
* Modified entitlements

---

### When is Delta Aggregation Used?

* Daily or scheduled synchronization
* Large enterprise environments
* Production systems
* Performance-sensitive IAM setups

---

### Real-Life IAM Example

**Application:** Active Directory

Changes in the last 24 hours:

* 3 new joiners
* 2 role changes
* 1 termination

**Delta Aggregation Result:**

* Only these 6 changes are processed
* Existing 50,000 accounts are untouched

---

### Key Characteristics

* Fast and efficient
* Low system and application load
* Scales well for millions of identities
* Depends on accurate change tracking

---

### Simple Analogy

Reading **today’s newspaper**, not the entire archive.

## 🔹 Full vs Delta Aggregation – Comparison

| Aspect      | Full Aggregation | Delta Aggregation |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Data Pulled | All data         | Only changed data |
| Speed       | Slow             | Fast              |
| System Load | High             | Low               |
| Frequency   | Rare             | Frequent          |
| Usage       | Initial setup    | Regular updates   |
| IAM Fit     | Baseline sync    | Production sync   |

---

## 🔹 SailPoint ISC UI vs Backend Behavior

* In **SailPoint ISC UI**, aggregation triggers **only Delta Aggregation**
* Full Aggregation **cannot be triggered directly from UI**
* Full Aggregation is executed via:

  * Backend APIs
  * Tools like **VS Code** or **Postman**

👉 Both VS Code and Postman internally use **SailPoint REST APIs**.

---

## 🔹 Enterprise IAM Best Practice

1. Run **Full Aggregation** during application onboarding
2. Schedule **Delta Aggregation** for daily or near-real-time updates
3. Use Full Aggregation only for major structural changes

This ensures:

* Accuracy
* Performance
* Scalability

---

## 🔹 Interview-Ready One-Liners

* **Full Aggregation:** Loads all application data every time, regardless of changes.
* **Delta Aggregation:** Loads only incremental changes since the last aggregation.

---

## 🔹 Why Delta Aggregation is Critical in IAM

* Enterprises manage millions of identities
* Frequent full aggregations degrade performance
* Delta aggregation enables scalable, cloud-ready IAM governance

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

> Use **Full Aggregation** to establish a baseline and **Delta Aggregation** to keep identities continuously in sync without impacting performance.
