# SailPoint ISC – Full and Delta Aggregation

---

## 1. What is Aggregation in SailPoint ISC?

Aggregation in **SailPoint Identity Security Cloud (ISC)** is the process of **collecting and synchronizing identity-related data from target applications into SailPoint**.

During aggregation, SailPoint pulls:

* User accounts
* Entitlements (roles, groups, permissions)
* Account–entitlement relationships

**In simple terms:**
Aggregation means **syncing application data into SailPoint** so identities can be governed.

---

## 2. Full Aggregation

### Definition

**Full Aggregation** is the process where **all data from the target application is fetched**, regardless of whether the data has changed or not.

It retrieves:

* All accounts
* All entitlements
* All account–entitlement mappings

---

### When is Full Aggregation Used?

* Initial application onboarding
* Major schema or attribute changes
* Data inconsistency or corruption scenarios
* Rare full reconciliation activities

---

### Real-Life IAM Example

**Application:** Active Directory (AD)

**Scenario:**
AD is integrated with SailPoint ISC for the first time.

* AD contains 50,000 user accounts
* SailPoint performs a Full Aggregation

**Result:**

* All 50,000 users are imported
* All AD groups are imported
* User–group relationships are established

Even if only one user changes later, Full Aggregation still fetches **all records**.

---

### Key Characteristics

* Time-consuming
* High system and application load
* Provides a complete snapshot of data
* Not recommended for frequent execution

---

### Simple Analogy

📘 Reading the **entire book again**, even though only one page was updated.

---

## 3. Delta Aggregation

### Definition

**Delta Aggregation** fetches **only the data that has changed** since the last successful aggregation.

It includes:

* Newly created accounts
* Modified accounts
* Deleted or disabled accounts
* Updated entitlements

---

### When is Delta Aggregation Used?

* Daily or scheduled synchronizations
* Large enterprise environments
* Production systems
* Performance-optimized identity governance

---

### Real-Life IAM Example

**Application:** Active Directory

**Changes in the last 24 hours:**

* 3 new employees joined
* 2 employees changed roles
* 1 employee left the organization

**Delta Aggregation Result:**

* Only these 6 changes are processed
* Existing 50,000 accounts are not re-fetched

---

### Key Characteristics

* Fast and efficient
* Low system and application load
* Scales well for large organizations
* Depends on accurate change tracking

---

### Simple Analogy

📰 Reading **today’s newspaper**, not the entire archive.

## 4. Full vs Delta Aggregation Comparison

| Aspect      | Full Aggregation            | Delta Aggregation     |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Data Pulled | All data                    | Only changed data     |
| Speed       | Slow                        | Fast                  |
| System Load | High                        | Low                   |
| Frequency   | Rare                        | Frequent              |
| Usage       | Initial setup / major fixes | Regular updates       |
| Best For    | Baseline sync               | Daily synchronization |

## 5. Enterprise IAM Best Practices

1. Run **Full Aggregation** during initial application onboarding.
2. Schedule **Delta Aggregation** for regular (daily or hourly) updates.
3. Use Full Aggregation only when major structural changes occur.

This approach ensures:

* Accuracy
* Performance
* Scalability in SailPoint ISC

---

## 6. Interview / Exam One-Liners

* **Full Aggregation:** Fetches complete application data every time, irrespective of changes.
* **Delta Aggregation:** Fetches only incremental changes since the last successful aggregation.

---

## 7. Why Delta Aggregation is Critical in IAM

* Enterprises manage millions of identities
* Frequent full aggregations cause performance bottlenecks
* Delta aggregation enables scalable, efficient, and production-ready identity governance
