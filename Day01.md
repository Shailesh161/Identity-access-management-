#  Day 1 ‚Äì Introduction to IAM

---

## What is IAM?

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a **security discipline** that enables the **right individuals or systems** to **access the right resources**, at the **right time**, and for the **right reasons**.

IAM helps organizations manage:

* **Who** can access systems (identity)
* **What** they can do (access/permissions)
* **How** and **when** they can do it (controls, rules, policies)

It includes processes like:

* User authentication & authorization
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Provisioning & deprovisioning
* Privileged access management

---

##  What is an Identity?

An **identity** is any entity (human or non-human) whose access to digital resources needs to be managed.

### üîπ Human Identity:

Represents real users such as:

* Employees
* Contractors
* Customers
* Partners

> **Example**: "Shailesh" (an employee) logs into the internal HR portal.

### üîπ Machine Identity:

Just like humans (employees or users) have usernames and passwords to access systems, machines also need a digital identity to securely communicate with other machines, apps, or services.These are called machine identities.

* Service accounts
* APIs
* Containers
* Bots
* Servers

> **Example**: 
* Use Case -A microservice calls another microservice
* Machine Identity Used-OAuth token or mTLS certificate

IAM systems treat both human and machine identities equally in terms of assigning roles, policies, and permissions.

---

##  What is Access?

**Access** refers to the level of **permissions granted to an identity** to perform specific operations on resources.

It includes:

* **Read** / **Write** / **Execute** access on files
* API access scopes
* Admin vs. user-level privileges

> **Example**:
>
> * An HR manager has read/write access to employee records.
> * A regular employee only has read access to their own record.

Access is governed by **policies**, **roles**, and **group memberships** defined in the IAM system.

---

##  Why Do Organizations Need IAM?

IAM is essential for both **security** and **compliance**, especially in today‚Äôs cloud-first, remote, and highly regulated environments.

### 1. **Security**

* Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data and systems
* Mitigates insider threats and external breaches
* Enforces least privilege access

### 2. **Compliance**

Helps meet legal and industry regulations like:


Companies that deal with sensitive data ‚Äî like health records, credit cards, or personal info ‚Äî must follow certain **rules and laws** to keep that data safe. These are called **compliance regulations**, and IAM plays a big part in helping companies follow them.

* **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
* **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
* **PCI-DSS** (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
* **SOX** (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)


#### **HIPAA** (USA ‚Äì Healthcare)

* Rule made for hospitals, clinics, or health-tech companies.
* It protects **patients' private health data**.

**IAM helps by**:

* Making sure only doctors or medical staff can see patient reports.
* Logging who accessed what and when.

> **Example**: A hospital uses IAM to ensure that only your assigned doctor can view your medical test results ‚Äî not everyone in the system.

---

####  **PCI DSS** (Global ‚Äì Payment Systems)

* This applies to any business that **accepts or handles credit/debit cards**.
* It protects your **payment information** from being misused or stolen.

**IAM helps by**:

* Making sure only payment systems or specific users can access card data.
* Enforcing **multi-factor authentication** for admins.

> **Example**: In an online shopping app, only the payment processor can see your card details ‚Äî the marketing or support team cannot.

---

####  **GDPR** (Europe ‚Äì Data Privacy)

* Made to protect the **privacy of people in the EU**.
* Gives users control over their own data (like deleting or downloading it).

**IAM helps by**:

* Giving data access only to people who need it.
* Letting users request data deletion or download.
* Keeping track of who accessed user data.

> **Example**: If you delete your account from a social media app, GDPR ensures your data is also deleted from the company‚Äôs systems ‚Äî and IAM helps make that happen securely.

---

####  **SOX** (USA ‚Äì Finance)

* Applies to public companies to prevent **fraud in financial data**.

**IAM helps by**:

* Making sure no single person can control everything (like creating and approving a payment).
* Tracking changes made to financial systems.
* Ensuring access is reviewed regularly.

> **Example**: In a finance department, one employee enters invoices and another approves them ‚Äî IAM makes sure this separation is enforced.

---

### Why This Matters


**IAM makes it easier to follow the rules** by:

* Controlling who has access to what
* Logging every access or change
* Making sure only the right people can see sensitive data


Non-compliance can lead to:

* Fines
* Lawsuits
* Loss of customer trust


### 3. **Audit & Reporting**



### What are Audits & How Does IAM Help? 

An **audit** is a check to make sure a company is **following rules, security policies, and compliance standards**.

Auditors may ask:

* Who accessed sensitive systems or data?
* Were users given more access than needed?
* Is old or unused access being removed?

---

###  How IAM Helps in Audits 

IAM makes audits much easier by:

*  **Tracking all access** 
  ‚Üí Keeps a record of who logged in, what they accessed, and when.

*  **Providing reports** 
  ‚Üí Quickly shows which users have access to what systems.

*  **Cleaning up unused access** 
  ‚Üí Helps remove access that is no longer needed.

*  **Enforcing policies** 
  ‚Üí Makes sure only the right people have access to sensitive data.

> **Example**: 
> If an auditor asks, ‚ÄúWho had access to the HR system last month?‚Äù,
> IAM can generate a full report in seconds.

Without IAM, doing this manually would take hours or even days.



### 4. **Operational Efficiency**

IAM automates: (JML - Joiner , Mover , Leaver)

* **User provisioning** (onboarding)
* **Access updates** (role changes)
* **Deprovisioning** (termination)

> Example: When a new employee joins via the HR system, IAM automatically assigns them appropriate access (JML flow).

### 5. **Scalability**

IAM systems allow organizations to scale securely from 10 users to 10,000+ users across departments and geographies.

---

##  What is Authentication?

**Authentication** is the process of **verifying the identity** of a user or system.

Common authentication methods include:

* Username & password
* OTP (One-Time Password)
* Biometrics (fingerprint, face scan)
* OAuth/OpenID tokens

> **Example**: Entering a password or scanning your fingerprint to access your laptop.

---

##  What is Authorization?

**Authorization** is the process of **determining what actions** a verified user or system is **allowed to perform**.

> **Example**:
> After successful login (authentication), IAM checks if the user has permission to:
>
> * View reports
> * Manage users
> * Access admin settings

**Authentication answers:** *"Who are you?"*
**Authorization answers:** *"What can you do?"*

## Security Principles IAM Follows ‚Äì The CIA Triad

The **CIA Triad** is a fundamental model in cybersecurity. IAM plays a key role in enforcing all three:

---

###  Confidentiality

Ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized users.

> Example: Only the finance team should have access to company budget files.

IAM enforces this via:

* Role-based access
* Policies
* Encryption

---

###  Integrity

Ensures that data is **accurate and cannot be modified** by unauthorized parties.

> Example: Audit logs should not be tampered with by regular users.

IAM supports this by:

* Allowing write permissions only to trusted roles
* Tracking changes (via logs)

---

###  Availability

Ensures systems and data are **available when needed**.

> Example: If the IAM system is down, employees may be locked out of business apps.

IAM supports high availability via:

* Load-balanced services
* Failover mechanisms
* Redundancy

---

## ‚ùóWhich Is Most Important in CIA?

In IAM, **Confidentiality** is often considered the most critical.

> Reason:
> If unauthorized users get access to sensitive data (like customer PII or passwords), it can lead to:
>
> * Legal consequences
> * Data breaches
> * Loss of reputation
